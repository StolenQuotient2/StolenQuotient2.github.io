<p>On this page I'm compiling many of the songs and albums that I've listened to and enjoyed over the years. In particular, anything that goes into the "Listening to:" part of the homepage of this website has been included on this list.</p>

<p>When possible, I've included Spotify embeds for these albums and songs. I've also sorted these songs into loose categories for easier browsing.</p>
