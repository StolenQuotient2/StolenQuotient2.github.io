        The Littlewood-Richardson coefficients $c^\nu_{\lambda,\nu}$ describe the product of 
        Schur functions.

        The following is an example of computing $c^\nu_{\lambda,\mu}$ using the rule described in <a href="https://sites.math.washington.edu/~billey/colombia/references/remmel.whitney.1984.pdf">this paper</a> by J. B. Remmel and R. Whitney. The coefficient is equal to the number of tableaux of shape $\nu$ which can be created by adding boxes in the blue-shaded positions subject to the following rules:
        <ol>
            <li>If $x$ and $x+1$ occur in the same row of the skew tableau on the left, then $x+1$ must occur in a cell weakly above and strictly to the right of the cell in which $x$ occurs in the tableau being created</li>
            <li>If $y$ occurs in the same column and in a row immediately below where $x$ occurs in the tableau on the left, then $y$ must occur in a cell which is strictly below and weakly to the left of $x$</li>
        </ol>
