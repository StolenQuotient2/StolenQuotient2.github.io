<div style="margin-bottom:15px;">The Arctic Circle theorem is a statement about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec_diamond">domino tilings of the aztec diamond</a>. Roughly, it says that a large tiling chosen at random will have a random circular area in the center and a predictable "frozen" pattern outside of this circle. The following image is an artistic interpretation of this theorem as a pear pie created by <a href="{{ site.data.people.lizzie.url }}">Lizzie Buchanan</a>, Beth Anne Castellano, <a href="{{ site.data.people.brian.url }}">Brian Mintz</a>, and myself on March 25, 2023. The dough has been colored by beet juice, carrot juice, and blueberry tea. The surface of the pie represents the random circle and the tiles outside the pie represent the frozen regions. </div>
