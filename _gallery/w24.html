<p>In January 2025, Misfits had its first Closed Beta test as project during Oberlin's Winter Term. Twelve new players, sorted into three groups, were introduced to the rules of the game and played though 3&ndash;4 session-long mini-campaigns in order to test the mechanics, flavor, and accessibility of the game.</p>

<p>The playtest was an overall success, since I gained a bunch of much-needed feedback from new players of the game. Much of my current work on the game is based on the feedback I recieved during this period of gameplay.</p>

<p>I plan to run another Closed Beta test of Misfits sometime in the future. In future betas I want to test larger and smaller parties, as well as have people other than me run the sessions and the game.</p>
