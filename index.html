<h2>About me</h2>
I am a mathematics and musical studies student at Oberlin College. I do a bunch of things. I'm currently working on getting this site up and running, so stay tuned! I am updating this layout from <a href="http://www.alexandernwilson.com">Alexander Wilson's</a> website, who let me use his website as a template. Not all work on the website is currently my own, but is either mine or Alex's.
